      <h2>A Designer</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Deriving inspiration from what is around me and understanding core design concepts allows me to create concise and exciting layouts. From logos, symbols and graphics to full web layouts I treat every project as an opportunity to push my limits and impress my clients. Weapons of choice include Adobe Illustrator (my main squeeze), Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Indesign, and Sketch 3.</p>

      <h2>A Developer</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Learning new technologies, languages, frameworks, methods and libraries has become a part of who I am. I’ve been developing for several years and I have come a long way but I recognize that there is still so much to know. With a background in multimedia technologies, I try to push the bar with every new project that I do. Weapons of choice include HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, JSON, Atom.io and massive amounts of coffee.</p>

      <h2>Practices</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Starting with a mobile first design I create simple yet effective user experiences from mobile to desktop. Other practices include using rem’s instead of pixels for improved scalability, optimizing assets to the smallest possible file size to improve load times, scaling assets appropriately so they look crisp on all devices, as well as using the .svg format whenever possible.</p>
